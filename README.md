# Product Quality Classification on Shopee through User Review Sentiments
Authors: Edgar Aaron A. Go and Rodolfo C. Camaclang III

This study explores the integration of machine learning into e-commerce platforms for automated product legitimacy detection, focusing on Shopee's Philippine site. By developing a Chrome browser extension that applies TF-IDF for text vectorization and logistic regression for classification, the system analyzes user reviews to determine the legitimacy of products. The study aims to protect consumers from counterfeit products while fostering an authentic marketplace for legitimate sellers. Data was collected from Shopee reviews, which were used to train and evaluate the model. The model achieved an accuracy of 84.5%, along with high precision, recall, and F1-scores. In terms of usability, a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 76.72 confirmed the extension as user-friendly and effective, providing a reliable solution to improve trust and transparency in e-commerce.
